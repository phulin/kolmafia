questL02Larva	started	We require your aid, Adventurer. We need a mosquito larva. Don't ask why, because we won't tell you. In any case, the best place to find a mosquito larva is in the Spooky Forest, which is found in the Distant Woods. We'll mark it on your map for you.	We still need a mosquito larva, Adventurer. Please find us one, in the Spooky Forest.
questL02Larva	finished	Thanks for the larva, Adventurer. Er, actually, y'know what? You look pretty lonely. Maybe you should hatch this larva and keep the mosquito as a pet.<p>To do so, you'll need a Familiar-Gro&trade; Terrarium at your campsite. You can use this Meat to buy one, if you don't already have one.	Thanks for the larva, Adventurer. We'll put this to good use.
questL03Rat	started	We've received word that the owner of The Typical Tavern, in The Distant Woods, is having a bit of a rat problem. I'm sure he'd reward you if you took care of it for him.	The owner of the Typical Tavern is still bugging us about his rat problems. Perhaps you could help him?
questL04Bat	started	The Council requires another task of you, Adventurer. You must slay the Boss Bat. He can be found in the deepest part of the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains. Slay him, and return to us with proof of your conquest.	You have not yet slain the Boss Bat. He can be found in the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains.
questL04Bat	finished	Well done!  You have slain the Boss Bat.
questL05Goblin	started	We've gotten word, Adventurer, that the Knob Goblins, who normally keep to themselves over at Cobb's Knob, are planning a major military action against Seaside Town.<p>We need for you to go deep into the Knob, and nip this problem in the bud, so to speak, by neutralizing the Goblin King.<p>Our spies have determined that there is a secret entrance that will allow you to access the inside of the Knob. They recovered this map, but nobody knows how to read it.<p>You'll need to figure out how to decrypt the symbols on it if you're going to find that entrance. And be careful with it, Adventurer. Many Bothans died to... oh, wait, never mind. That was something else.	You need to find your way into Cobb's Knob, Adventurer. Try looking around the Outskirts for a clue that might help you figure out that map we gave you.	We still need you to neutralize the Goblin King, Adventurer!
questL05Goblin	finished	Thank you for slaying the Goblin King, Adventurer.
questL06Friar	started	The Deep Fat Friars in the Distant Woods are having a problem -- one of the experiments has gone awry, and fey creatures have invaded their grove. Please, Adventurer, lend them your assistance.	The Deep Fat Friars still require your assistance. You can find them in the Distant Woods.
questL07Cyrptic	started	Recently, an aura of extreme Spookiness has begun to emanate from within the Cyrpt, near the Misspelled Cemetary. We fear that some horrible monster has taken up residence there, and begun to rile up the local undead.<p>Would you be so good as to investigate? This device should help:	The Spookiness still emanates from the Cyrpt, Adventurer. See if you can find and destroy the source, and bring us back proof of your conquest.
questL07Cyrptic	finished	Aha! So the Spookiness was coming from this abominable creature, was it? Well, you have our thanks, Adventurer, for your courageous act of undefilement.<p>Please, allow us to fashion that skull into something a little flashier.
questL08Trapper	started	Adventurer! We've received an urgent letter from the Trapper, requesting our assistance. We're, like, really busy right now, so we were hoping you could go out to his place and see what he wants.<p>He lives at the base of Mt. McLargeHuge, the tallest of the Big Mountains. We'll mark it on your map for you.	You still have unfinished business with the Trapper, Adventurer.
questL09Topping	started	Sorry to trouble you with this, Adventurer, but we've gotten a... shall we say... cryptic message from Black Angus -- he's one of Loathing's minor nobles.<p>It's usually safe to ignore him, but he sounded pretty agitated, and given the current political climate we can scarcely afford to ignore him.<p>Could you do us a favor and go to his tower, in the Highlands?  The Highlands are just on the other side of the Orc Chasm.  We'll mark it on your map.	The Highland Lord, Black Angus, still needs your help, Adventurer.
questL10Garbage	started	Something is amiss, Adventurer. The Nearby Plains are filling up with giant piles of garbage, and despite our best efforts, it keeps falling from the sky faster than we can clean it up. We need you to figure out where it's coming from, and put a stop to it.	Please try to figure out where this garbage is coming from, Adventurer! Perhaps you can find a clue by poking around the Nearby Plains.
questL10Garbage	finished	We're not sure what you did, Adventurer, but the garbage finally stopped falling.  Thanks a lot!<p>Oh, by the way -- we found this in the garbage when we were cleaning up, and thought you might have some use for it.
questL11MacGuffin	started	You can travel there from the Travel Agency at The Shore, but there's a slight hitch -- the area you're going to requires a passport for entry, and our passport offices are temporarily closed due to a tiny photograph shortage. You'll need to acquire some forged identification documents from the Black Market instead, but we're not entirely sure where the Black Market actually is. It's probably near the Black Forest, though, and we'll mark that on your map for you.	Any luck getting your father's diary and recovering the Holy MacGuffin? It's a pretty important whatchamacallit, so we'd appreciate it if you'd get on that right away.
questL11MacGuffin	finished	And one quick (though enjoyable) tickertape parade later, you're standing back in front of the Council Hall, picking bits of confetti out of your hair and wondering what you should do next.
questL12War	started	Adventurer, we have heard rumors that trouble is brewing on the Mysterious Island of Mystery. The hippies and frat boys are agitating for war. I mean, they've always been a little tense with each other, but now it's getting serious. We couldn't be happier.<p>We'd like you to go over there and make sure that war starts. We don't care how it starts and we don't care who wins. Maybe the hippies will wipe out the frat boys, or maybe the frat boys will annihilate the hippies, or maybe they'll eradicate each other. It's kind of like watching two hot girls mud-wrestle -- no matter who loses, we win.	Hey, have you managed to start the war on the Mysterious Island yet? If you can't get them sufficiently worked up, try assassinating Franz Ferdinand. Historically, that tends to work.
questL12War	step1	Excellent work, adventurer! You've finally managed to get those idiots to fight each other. Now you've got to make sure the battle ends before the tourist season. I mean, would you rather go visit the "beautiful tropical island" or the "body-strewn war zone?"
questL12War	finished	Here you go -- you're now a decorated war hero. Don't let it go to your head. 
questL13Final	started	Adventurer!  We've recently received word that the Naughty Sorceress is holding some sort of contest.  We don't know what it means, but we know it doesn't mean anything good, and as such, we have decided that it is time for you to embark upon your final quest.  Seek out and destroy the Naughty Sorceress, who has plagued these lands for so long, and rescue King Ralph XI, whom she has imprismed.<p>Go forth to her Lair, east of the Nearby Plains!  Beat her down!
questL13Final	step13	Congratulations, Adventurer! You have defeated the Naughty Sorceress and brought peace to the land again. Say, did you know she was your mother?<p>Nah, just kidding. Anyway, I notice you left the king imprismed up there. It would be horrible if you left him there, because then the monsters would continue to fight adventurers and we would continue to have absolute power throughout the land. Yup, that sure would be a drag.<p>I guess you should probably go free him, though. But, y'know, take your time. If there's anything really important you have to do first, like brushing your teeth or cleaning your campsite, just go ahead and do that.<p>Seriously, no rush.
questL13Final	finished	Congratulations, Adventurer! It's the end of your quest as we know it. Don't worry, we feel fine. You've freed the king and made us obsolete. Ah, well. Hail to the king, baby.

# Sneaky Pete
questL02Larva	started	Uh, hey, dude, we could use some help if you're not mad busy. We need a mosquito larva. We won't bore you with our totes lame reasons why. You can find them in the Spooky Forest, in the Distant Woods. We'd be hella salty grateful if you could snag us one, yo.	Hey, homes, we still need that mosquito larva. We'll totally do your math homework for you if you get one for us! It's in the Spooky Forest.	Uh, hey, dudette, we could use some help if you're not mad busy. We need a mosquito larva. We won't bore you with our totes lame reasons why. You can find them in the Spooky Forest, in the Distant Woods. We'd be hella salty grateful if you could snag us one, yo.
questL02Larva	finished	Sweet! Thanks for getting the larva for us. That was totes chill of you.
questL03Rat	started	S'up, righteous dude. I know this isn't really worthy of your mad skills, but the owner of the Typical Tavern in the Distant Woods is trippin' about some rodent problem. I'm sure he'd give you mad props if you totes knocked 'em out.	S'up, righteous dudette. I know this isn't really worthy of your mad skills, but the owner of the Typical Tavern in the Distant Woods is trippin' about some rodent problem. I'm sure he'd give you mad props if you totes knocked 'em out.
questL04Bat	started	Hey, uh, homes. What's up? Any drama in the LBC? Heh, so we've got this grody Boss Bat who is, uh, sweating us to the max. If you're not too busy, like, could you throw some smack on him? He lives in the deepest part of the Bat Hole, in the nearby plains. So, y'know, cowabunga!	Hey, sis, I'm not trying to stress you, dawg, but I have to be "The Man" here and point out the Boss Bat is still alive. Which is not tubular, you know? Scope him out at the Bat Hole, by the Nearby Plains.
questL04Bat	finished	Hey, uh, dog, it was poppin' fresh how you iced the Boss Bat! We made this belt out of his skin for you. I mean, I know it's totally lame, but you can have it.
questL05Goblin	started	Hey, dude, we just got the 411 that the Knob Goblins are all panty-twisted and totes want to attack Seaside Town. What a bunch of douchegrass, am I right?<p>We think it's time some righteous bro went into the Knob and took out the Goblin King.<p>Our spies found out about a secret entrance that'll let you get all up ins. They found this map, but it's mad encrypted.<p>So could you, y'know, in your spare time, maybe poke around and see if you can get in there? You'd be doing us a solid. Peace out.	Yo, home...stuck?, we still really need you to get into Cobb's Knob, y'know, if you've got the time. You can probably find a clue on the Outskirts for how to get in.	Hey, I saw that the Goblin King is still stompin' around, yo. Have you not had a chance to get jiggy on him yet?
questL05Goblin	finished	You totally knocked that Goblin King out like a punk. Tubular work!
questL06Friar	started	Hey, homeskittle, those lameoid Deep Fat Friars opened some kind of weird portal, and all kinds of grody to the max demons are invading their grove. It would be totes, uh, dope if you could help them out.	Hey, daddy-o, those wack demons are still bothering those fuddy-duddy Friars. If, y'know, you feel like it, you should help them out in the Distant Woods.
questL07Cyrptic	started	Uh, what's up, homeboy? We hate to bother you, but there's, like, mad Spookiness coming out of the Cyrpt, near the Misspelled Cematary in the Nearby Plains. Some total dweeboid monster is probably in there, riling up the undead. It'd be totes sweet if you could check it out for us.<p>This thing will probably help -- we don't know, it's probably some nerd stuff, so whatever -- but, uh, could you look into it? If you've got time?	Yo, uh, home...slice? Is that what you kids say? Um, anyway, the Cyrpt is still super Spooky--I mean, I'm sure you're busy with cool stuff, like, being a cool guy, you know, but could you please get rid of the source, and bring back proof you did it? I mean, we trust you, but...yeah.
questL07Cyrptic	finished	Wow, so this was the crumbum Spookying up the Cyrpt? Looks like you, uh, totes dealt with him.<p>Here, let us make that skull into something badass enough for you to wear. 
questL08Trapper	started	S'up, homeslice? I know you're busy doing cool stuff, but we just got a letter from the Trapper, and he's got 99 problems. Could you maybs check out whatever tip he's on? That'd be mad awesome.<p>He lives at the base of Mt. McLargeHuge, the tallest of the Big Mountains. We'll mark it on your map for you.	I don't want to tell you your business, homeskittle, but the Trapper's still freaking out about whatever. You should probs check it out.
questL09Topping	started	Hey, dawg, sorry to bother you with this, but we just got a wack-ass message from Black Angus, this, like, wannabe royal.<p>Usually, we just let him talk all the jabber he wants, but he sounds totes off his rock this time.<p>Could you go get the 411 on what his damage is? His pad is in the Highlands, just around the Orc Chasm. We'll map it up for you.	Hey, dude, Black Angus is still mad tripping about whatever tip he's on. You should totes hit him up.
questL10Garbage	started	S'up, dude. The Nearby Plains are filling up with these totally unhip and wack piles of garbage. If you've got time, could you see where it's coming from and put a stop to it? That'd be tight.	We don't want to be, like, a bunch of fascist squares or anything, but the garbage is still falling from the sky over in the Nearby Plains. So, uh, what's up with that?	S'up, dudette. The Nearby Plains are filling up with these totally unhip and wack piles of garbage. If you've got time, could you see where it's coming from and put a stop to it? That'd be tight.
questL10Garbage	finished	Wow, you totally got jiggy with that whole garbage situation, homes! That's what the kids say, right? "Got jiggy" means "got it done?"<p>Anyway, we found this thing while we were cleaning up. It looked like something you could maybe use.
questL11MacGuffin	started	You can get it if you take your whip to the Travel Agency at The Shore, but they're totally going to sweat you unless you have a passport. You should, uh, hit up the Black Market for some bogus creds. We're sure you know where that is, but we're not cool enough to get told, so we'll just send you to the Black Forest and you can get there from there.<p>Once you've got ol' fossil dad's book, you could track down the MacGuffin for us, if you don't have anything better to do. It'll probs help us defeat the Sorceress, so, you know. Whatever.	Hey, dude, have you had a chance to scope the deets on the Holy Watchamacallit yet? We could really use it, so it'd be proppa if you could get on that.
questL11MacGuffin	finished	And one quick (though enjoyable) tickertape parade later, you're standing back in front of the Council Hall, picking bits of confetti out of your hair and wondering what you should do next.
questL12War	started	Hey, homes, we've heard some downlow intel that peeps on the Mysterious Island of Mystery are getting salty with each other. Those wacked-out hippies and gnarly frat boys seem about to start a war. I mean, those dudes don't really chill together regardless, but now they're thirsty for blood. Hella thirsty. This seems like a good time to really spark some stuff.<p>If you have time, could you scope out the sitch and make sure the war starts? It doesn't matter who wins or how it starts, just set it off.<p>Maybe the hippies will wipe out the frat boys, or maybe the frat boys will annihilate the hippies, or maybe they'll eradicate each other. It's kind of like watching two hot girls mud-wrestle -- no matter who loses, we win. Word.	Yo, homestar, have you got the war started on the island yet? If you can't heat things up, try assassinating Franz Ferdinand. That would totes twist some panties.
questL12War	step1	Man, you're tearing it up on the island, adventurer! Totally radical and gnarly! You've got those idiots, like, hella salty fighting each other. Now you've just got to end the war before those lame dork tourists start showing up.<p>Nah, you don't have to fight for one side in particular, dawg. We're not going to be all fascist and say what side to join. Heck, take out both sides! That'd be dope!<p>If you get bored doing this stuff--I mean, we know the world bores you when you're cool--you could chat up some of the other people who live on the island. Most of 'em are dweebs, but some might be able to help. Take it easy, brah!
questL12War	finished	That was totes gnarly, adventurer! You totally beat down those dweeboid hippies. The tourists are going to enjoy not having to hold their noses while they buy their lame, pointless souvenirs!<p>If only you had taken out those douchey frat boys, too. Oh, well. At least their margaritas are hella tight.<p>Wear this with pride--or, y'know, cool indifference.
questL13Final	started	You are seriously one bad mutha--sorry, I'll shut my mouth. The Council thinks you're ready to step up to that crazy sheila who's responsible for all this nonsense. Go lay some knowledge on that nonsense! Drop her like she's hot! Bounce her like a bad check! And free King Ralph, y'know, if you get around to it.<p>Go scope out her Lair, east of the Nearby Plains! Beat her down!	Yo, friend-o, the Naughty Sorceress is still out there going crazy on the murderous tip! You gots to totes drop her! She's in her Lair, east of the Nearby Plains!	Congratulations, bromide! You straight up 86'd the Naughty Sorceress and made all the wack daddies out there chill. Say, did you know she was your mother?<p>Nah, just messin' with you. But hey, you totes left the king imprismed up there. It'd be straight-up hella ignorant if you left him up there, because the monsters would keep on sweatin' the whole land and we'd be in absolute power still. Yup, that'd be some crazy messed-up plumbing.<p>You should probs let him fly, though. But, y'know, take your time. Comb your 'do, spiff your campsite, ghost ride your whip, whatever.<p>Seriously, no rush

# Heavy Rains
questL02Larva	started	We require your aid, Adventurer.  As you know, there's a freak storm happening right now that is dumping rain all over the Kingdom. Because of this, we naturally need a mosquito larva. The best place to find a mosquito larva is in the Spooky Forest, which is found in the Distant Woods.  We'll mark it on your map for you.	We still need a mosquito larva, Adventurer.  Please find us one in the Spooky Forest.
questL02Larva	finished	Thanks for the larva, Adventurer. This could be the key to ending the rain that's plaguing the Kingdom! Probably not, but it's worth a shot, right?
questL03Rat	started	We've received word that the owner of the Typical Tavern, in the Distant Woods, is having a bit of a rat problem.  I'm sure he'd reward you if you took care of it for him. And maybe bail out his basement while you're there. Honestly, if we'd have known it was going to rain in the Kingdom like, ever, we would have put a sump pump down there.	The Tavern Owner is still having rat problems, Adventurer. Why don't you splash or row your way to the Distant Woods and help him out?
questL04Bat	started	Adventurer, the bats in the Bat Hole have been even more restless than usual. The water is flooding their caves, washing away centuries-old guano deposits, and they're not happy about it. There have been rumors that the Boss Bat has vanished, to be replaced by some watery creature.<p>Naturally, we're going to stay inside where it's dry, but we figured you should go check it out. And, y'know, take out whatever creature is down there at the bottom.	We've heard that the Bathole is flooded, and there's some weird water creature down there. Is that true? I mean, no matter what's in there, we still need you to kill it and bring back some proof.
questL04Bat	finished	So the Boss Bat was all made out of water? That's incredibly weird.
questL05Goblin	started	We've gotten word, Adventurer, that the Knob Goblins, who normally keep to themselves over at Cobb's Knob, are planning a major military action. It must be due to the flooding that's inundated the Knob--they're in deep water over there, and they may be looking to expand their territory.<p>We need for you to go deep into the Knob and nip this problem in the bud, so to speak, by neutralizing the Goblin King.<p>Our spies have determined that there is a secret entrance that will allow you to access the inside of the Knob.  They recovered this map, but nobody knows how to read it.<p>You'll need to figure out how to decrypt the symbols on it if you're going to find that entrance.  And be careful with it, Adventurer.  Many Bothans died to... oh, wait, never mind.  That was something else.	We still need you to get into Cobb's Knob, Adventurer. Try searching through the mud in the Outskirts for a clue.
questL05Goblin	step1	Any luck with the Goblin King, Adventurer? Is he still in charge over there, or did the flood take him?
questL05Goblin	finished	Ah, you've slain the Goblin King? Oh, it wasn't him? It was some thing made out of water that only looked like him?<p>Well, that's pretty strange. Keep us posted, okay?
questL06Friar	started	The Deep Fat Friars in the Distant Woods have sent a request for aid, Adventurer. Their Copse was built on one of the soft places in the world, and the flood has only made the ground softer. Creatures from the depths of Hey Deze have begun to invade, and they are powerless against the demons.	The Friars are still bugging us about their flooded Copse, Adventurer. Please squelch on over to the Distant Woods and help them out, won't you?
questL07Cyrptic	started	Recently, an aura of extreme Spookiness has begun to emanate from within the Cyrpt, near the Misspelled Cemetary in the Nearby Plains.  We fear the floodwaters have released some ancient evil, and it's taken root deep inside.<p>Would you be so good as to investigate?  This device should help:	The Cyrpt is still radiating Spookiness, Adventurer, and the water isn't getting any shallower in there. Have you explored every nook and cranny?
questL07Cyrptic	finished	So there was a water dragon in the Cyrpt? Huh. That's unexpected. We thought it would just be an ancient skeletal dragon, like usual. This rain is absolutely crazy, Adventurer.
questL08Trapper	started	Adventurer!  We've received an urgent letter from the Trapper, requesting our assistance.  We're busy trying to move the archives to higher ground and plug the leaks in the ceiling, so we were hoping you could go out to his place and see what he wants.<p>He lives at the base of Mt. McLargeHuge, the tallest of the Big Mountains.  We'll mark it on your map for you.	The Trapper tells us you haven't finished helping him yet, Adventurer. So, y'know, get on that, will you?
questL09Topping	started	Sorry to trouble you with this, Adventurer, but we've gotten a... shall we say... cryptic message from Black Angus -- he's one of Loathing's minor nobles.<p>It's usually safe to ignore him, but he sounded pretty agitated, and the rain's got everyone so on edge that we can't afford to ignore him.<p>Could you do us a favor and go to his tower, in the Highlands?  The Highlands are just on the other side of the Orc Chasm.  We'll mark it on your map.	The Highland Lord, Black Angus, still needs your help, Adventurer.
questL10Garbage	started	Adventurer, in addition to the water raining down on the Nearby Plains, there's also a lot of giant garbage coming from above. It's turning all the puddles and mud into gross glop. Can you please investigate and see where it's coming from, and how to stop it?	Please try to figure out where the garbage is coming from, adventurer! Perhaps you'll find a clue where all the garbage is landing, in the Nearby Plains. Maybe you can get above the clouds? Man, that'd be nice. We haven't had dry socks in ages.
questL10Garbage	finished	The garbage has stopped falling, Adventurer! Great work. I don't suppose you found a way to stop the rain from doing the same?<p>Oh, well. Here, we found this during the cleanup. It's yours.
questL11MacGuffin	started	You can travel there from the Travel Agency at The Shore, but there's a slight hitch -- the area you're going to requires a passport for entry, and our passport offices are temporarily closed due to a tiny photograph shortage. You'll need to acquire some forged identification documents from the Black Market instead, but we're not entirely sure where the Black Market actually is. It's probably near the Black Forest, though, and we'll mark that on your map for you.	Any luck getting your father's diary and recovering the Holy MacGuffin? It's a pretty important whatchamacallit, so we'd appreciate it if you'd get on that right away. I mean, the flood's not getting any shallower.
questL11MacGuffin	finished	&quot;Wow! You actually brought back the Holy MacGuffin, Darzil? That's pretty darn impressive -- well done! Now we can pack it in an unlabelled wooden crate and stash it in a secret warehouse full of similar crates somewhere where it's likely that no one will ever see it again. Thanks for your help!&quot;<p>&quot;That's it?&quot; you ask. &quot;There wasn't some holy umbrella in there or anything?&quot; <p>&quot;Nah, we're afraid to open it, honestly. You'll have to stop the rain some other way. But I guess you deserve a reward. You like parades? We could throw a parade.&quot;<p>&quot;Sure.&quot;<p>So the Council throws you a ticker-tape parade, which gets soggy and gross pretty quickly in the never-ending rain. To be honest, you're pretty glad when it's over.
questL12War	started	Adventurer, we have heard rumors that trouble is brewing on the Mysterious Island of Mystery.  The hippies and frat boys have always been a little tense with each other, but the endless rain is really exacerbating the situation. The frat boys keep holding Wet T-Shirt Contests where the hippies are trying to have their Free Love Mudwrestling. Nothing ruins a wet t-shirt contest like a bunch of naked people, and nothing ruins a love-in like total pervs creeping on everyone. So nobody's happy except us. <p>We'd like you to go over there and make sure that war starts. We don't care how it starts and we don't care who wins.<p>Maybe the hippies will wipe out the frat boys, or maybe the frat boys will annihilate the hippies, or maybe they'll eradicate each other. No matter who loses, we win.	Hey, have you managed to start the war on the Mysterious Island yet? If you can't get them sufficiently worked up, try assassinating Franz Ferdinand. Historically, that tends to work.
questL12War	step1	Excellent work, adventurer! You've finally managed to get those idiots to fight each other. Now you've got to make sure the battle ends before the tourist season. We mean, assuming the rainy season ever stops. It's a miracle we haven't grown webbed feet yet!<p>Anyway, let's get this war over with, shall we? Get out there and rack up some casualties!<p>If you're not making enough progress, you should try helping some of the other denizens of the island. Unlike every other fantasy Kingdom in the world, if you're stuck you should visit every location and talk to everyone.
questL12War	finished	Good job, adventurer! You finally rid the island of those smelly hippies. The tourist trade is going to boom without them stinking up the place! Did you take out their leader, the Big Wisniewski?<p>Oh, there was some water-based copy of him there, instead? How bizarre. The rain, the crazy water mini-bosses...it's got to be connected somehow. Eh, we're sure you'll figure it out.<p>Now, if only there were something we could do about the frat boys. Oh well, at least they make good margaritas.<p>Here you go -- you're now a decorated war hero.  Don't let it go to your head.	Great work, adventurer! You finally rid the island of those smug bastard frat boys. The tourist trade is going to boom now that travelers don't have to worry about being forced to do beer bongs while being paddled. Now they can choose to be paddled without doing a beer bong or vice versa! Did you really stick it to the Man, the guy who pulls all the strings over there?<p>Oh, that's weird. the Aquaman? But without the green speedo and orange unitard? Huh. We can't help but think there may be a connection between the endless rain and all these mini-bosses made of sentient water. Eh, you'll figure it out.<p>Now if only there were something we could do about the hippies. Oh well, at least they're mostly non-violent. As long as you don't get close enough to smell them, they're okay.<p>Here you go -- you're now a decorated war hero.  Don't let it go to your head.
questL13Final	started	Adventurer, the time has come! Clouds are gathering thick and dark around the Sorceress's tower. She must be causing all the flooding! Put an end to her and you'll put an end to this whole soggy business.<p>Splash forth to her lair, east of the Nearby Plains, and wring her like a mop!
questL13Final	step13	So, it was the Rain King that was making all the rain? Well, we suppose that makes sense. Kings, man. You can't live with 'em, you can't leave 'em stuck in a prism where they can't do any harm while a representative democratic Council fairly and gently enforces order. Am I right?<p>I mean, you're an Adventurer, not a politician. It probably wouldn't do for you to meddle in affairs of state like re-establishing the monarchical status quo. Best to leave it to us.<p>Well, I mean, we can't stop you if you want to break the King's prism...and we suppose that is the heroic thing to do...aw, man. Just don't rush into it, okay? There's plenty of time. No hurry.

# West of Loathing
questL02Larva	started	Okay Cowboy, here's the first thing we need you to do: go find us a mosquito larva. Are you familiar with those? Probably not, since they don't live in the god-forsaken desert. It's like a little wriggly thing. You can find one in the Spooky Forest, which is in the Distant Woods. Here, I'd better write this down for you.	We still need a mosquito larva, pardner.  Please find us one, in the Spooky Forest.
questL02Larva	finished	Thanks for the larva, pardner.  We'll put this to good use. No, don't worry your rustic little head about it.
questL03Rat	started	We've received word that the owner of the Typical Tavern -- sorry, "Saloon" -- in the Distant Woods, is having a bit of a rat problem. I'm sure he'd reward you if you took care of it for him.	The owner of the Typical Tavern is still bugging us about his rat problems.  Go round them up, or rustle them, or whatever you do, okay?
questL04Bat	started	The Council requires another task of you, pardner.  You must slay the Boss Bat.  He can be found in the deepest part of the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains. Slay him, and return to us with proof of your conquest. Like, I dunno, his scalp or something. You're probably into that.	We're still waiting on you to kill the Boss Bat. It's not meant to be a duel or anything, you don't have to wait 'til "High Noon". He can be found in the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains.
questL04Bat	finished	You really did kill the Boss Bat! Good going! We used to have some fancy leather belts we'd give away as thanks for that kind of thing, but it looks like we're out. Oh well!
questL05Goblin	started	We've gotten word, pardner, that the Knob Goblins, who normally keep to themselves over at Cobb's Knob, are planning a major military action against Seaside Town. You know, they're "on the warpath".<p>We need for you to go deep into the Knob, and take care of the Goblin King. Basically, we want him "Dead or Alive", except really we just want him dead.<p>Our spies have determined that there is a secret entrance that will allow you to access the inside of the Knob.  They recovered this map, but nobody here knows how to read it, so I am 100% certain you don't either.<p>You'll need to figure out how to decrypt the symbols on it if you're going to find that entrance.	You need to find your way into Cobb's Knob, pardner.  Try looking around the Outskirts for a clue that might help you figure out that map we gave you.
questL05Goblin	step1	We're still waiting for you to kill the Goblin King, pardner. If you need motivation, just imagine he stole your horse or something.
questL05Goblin	finished	Good job killing the Goblin King, pardner. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that you're so good at this, since you come from a place that's known for being violent and lawless.
questL06Friar	started	Okay um, how do I explain this one to you... See, there're these guys in the Distant Woods called the Deep Fat Friars. I think you'd call them "Rev'rends" or something. Anyway, one of their rituals went bad, and they raised a devil, except literally. And a lot more than one. So we need you to ride out there and sort it out.	The Deep Fat Friars still need help. Better hop along, Cassidy.
questL07Cyrptic	started	Recently, an aura of extreme Spookiness has begun to emanate from within the Cyrpt, near the Misspelled Cemetary in the Nearby Plains.  We fear that some horrible monster has taken up residence there, and begun to rile up the local undead. They're "makin' a ruckus", you might say.<p>Head on over there and check it out for us, okay? Here, I'll loan you this... jeez, how do I explain it to you... you know a dowsing rod, right? Like a forked stick you guys use to find water, as if that were a real thing? Well think of this as a dowsing rod for evil.	Things are still pretty spooky out at the Cyrpt, pardner. Better get those spurs to jinglin'.
questL07Cyrptic	finished	A skeletal dragon? Are you sure it wasn't a "chalupacabra" or something? Ha ha nah just kidding. Thanks for your help, seriously.
questL08Trapper	started	Adventurer!  Say, here's just the job for you --  we got a letter from a fur trapper out in the mountains. He seems like somebody you could relate to, right?  Why don't you "git along little doggie" and go see what he wants?<p>He lives at the base of Mt. McLargeHuge, the tallest of the Big Mountains.  We'll mark it on your map for you.	According to our Big City magic, you've still got unfinished business with the Trapper.
questL09Topping	started	Hey, sorry to interrupt your calf-roping or branding or wagon-circling or whatever, but we've gotten a message from one of the local nobles, a lord named Black Angus. 'Lord' is a political thing, I guess the closest title you'd be used to is 'Governor', or something like that. Anyway he's a pretty important guy so I probably shouldn't entrust this to -- let's be honest here -- a country bumpkin, but you've been doing a pretty good job so far I guess. Just go see what he wants, it's probably not that complicated. Here, we'll mark the place on your map.	Did you finish helping the Highland Lord? No? Well what in "tarnation" are you doing back here then?
questL10Garbage	started	Say, did you notice all that garbage out on the Nearby Plains? Since you're new around here, I figure I should point out that it's not usually like that. I'd ask you to go clean it up for us, but maybe if you could find out where it's actually coming from and stop it at the source, that would be more efficient.	We're still waiting on you to fix that whole garbage situation out in the Nearby Plains. Giddyap!
questL10Garbage	finished	Was it you that fixed the whole giant garbage situation? Well I'll be an armadillo's great-aunt, or some other similar down-home colloquialism. Here, have a piece of garbage as a memento of your fine work.
questL11MacGuffin	started	You can travel there from the Travel Agency at The Shore, but there's a slight hitch -- the area you're going to requires a passport for entry, and we can't issue you one because you aren't actually a native resident. You'll have to acquire some forged identification documents from the Black Market instead. We're not entirely sure where the Black Market actually is, but it's probably near the Black Forest. We'll mark that on your map for you.	Any luck getting your father's diary and recovering the Holy MacGuffin? It's a pretty important whatchamacallit, so we'd appreciate it if you'd get on that right away. If it helps with the sense of urgency, just imagine there's a twister a-comin', or something like that.
questL11MacGuffin	finished	Wow! You actually brought back the Holy MacGuffin, Bale? That's pretty darn impressive, especially for a backwoods country bumpkin. ...I'm sorry, I guess that's pretty insulting of me. Let's say "backwoods country hayseed" instead. Anyway, thanks for your help! We held a parade in honor of the MacGuffin's arrival, but I think everyone assumed someone else would tell you about it. We saved you a handful of confetti, though.
questL12War	started	Hey there, cowpoke -- we've got another job for you. We've heard rumors that trouble is brewing on the Mysterious Island of Mystery. The hippies and frat boys are agitating for war. I mean, they've always been a little tense with each other, but now it's getting serious. We couldn't be happier.<p>We'd like you to go over there and make sure that war starts. We don't care how it starts and we don't care who wins, so there's basically no way for you to screw this up, so long as you don't accidentally negotiate a peace accord. Try not to do that.	Hey, have you managed to start the war on the Mysterious Island yet? I can't imagine it'd be very difficult, especially for someone with such a lawless and violent background. If you can't get them sufficiently worked up, try assassinating Franz Ferdinand. Historically, that tends to work.
questL12War	step1	Excellent work, pardner! You've finally managed to get those idiots to fight each other. Now you've got to make sure the battle ends before the tourist season. I mean, would you rather go visit the &quot;beautiful tropical island&quot; or the &quot;body-strewn war zone?&quot;<p>Well, there's no accounting for taste. We happen to believe most people would prefer the beautiful tropical island. Get out there and rack up some casualties so we can get this over with, will you? Scratch that itchy trigger-finger of yours.<p>If you're not making enough progress, you should try helping some of the other denizens of the island. Unlike every other fantasy Kingdom in the world, if you're stuck you should visit every location and talk to everyone. Remeber: talk <i>before</i> shoot
questL12War	finished	Good job, pardner! You finally rid the island of those smelly hippies. You probably didn't notice yourself, but those guys really do stink. The tourist trade is going to boom without them hanging around!<p>Now, if only there were something we could do about the frat boys. Oh well, at least they make good margaritas.<p>Here you go -- you're now a decorated war hero.  Don't let it go to your head. And yes, it's real, you don't have to bite it to make sure.
questL13Final	started	Howdy, pardner!  We've recently received word that the Naughty Sorceress is holding some sort of contest.  We don't know what it means, but we know it doesn't mean anything good, and despite the fact that your chances of winning are probably zero plus or minus negative zero, we have decided that it is time for you to embark upon your final quest.  Seek out and destroy the Naughty Sorceress, who has plagued these lands for so long, and rescue King Ralph XI, whom she has imprismed.	Giddyap, cowhand! You must defeat the Naughty Sorceress, so that we don't have to ask someone more valuable to do it!  You'll find her Lair just east of the Nearby Plains.<p>Her lair is east of the Nearby Plains. Good luck! We're all rootin'-tootin' for ya!
questL13Final	step13	Congratulations, pardner! You have defeated the Naughty Sorceress and brought peace to the land again. Say, did you know she was your mother?<p>Nah, just kidding. Nobody knows who your mother is. Anyway, I notice you left the king imprismed up there. It would be horrible if you left him there, because then the monsters would continue to fight adventurers and we would continue to have absolute power throughout the land. Yup, that sure would be a drag.<p>I guess you should probably go free him, though. But, y'know, take your time. If there's anything really important you have to do first, like flossing your horse or whittling, just go ahead and do that.<p>Seriously, no rush.

# Zombie Slayer
questL02Larva	started	Yes. Mosquitoes spread all kinds of diseases, after all. Go get one in the Spooky Forest, which is within the Distant Woods. Here, push your map under the door, and I'll mark the location for you.
questL02Larva	finished	"Hey in there!" you call out. "I found you a mosquito larva."
questL03Rat	started	"Yes, the cellar there is generally swarming with them. No need to bring us back a sample this time, just clean the place out and report back. Let us know if any of the rats are behaving... strangely."
questL04Bat	started	"The next potential plague-vector we need you to check out is the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains. Go kill the Boss Bat and bring us back some kind of sample for us to test."
questL04Bat	finished	"Okay, I brought you a sample from the Boss Bat," you say, pushing the bandanna under the door.
questL05Goblin	started	"Correct. And to do that you'll have to go right to the top -- neutralize the Goblin King. We have a map here, but unfortunately it's encrypted with some kind of Knob Goblin cypher, so you'll need to figure that out first."
questL05Goblin	step1	"I need a little more time," you say. "He's pretty well defended."
questL05Goblin	finished	"Okay," you call through the panic-room door. "I killed the Goblin King."
questL06Friar	started	"We've just received a radio transmission from the Deep Fat Friars in the Distant Woods," the Councillor says. "Some kind of distress signal."
questL07Cyrptic	started	"After some debate, we've decided that the most constructive location for you to investigate next would be the Cyrpt, near the Misspelled Cemetary in the Nearby Plains."
questL07Cyrptic	finished	"I've cleared out the Cyrpt," you tell the Councillor through the locked door. "There wasn't anything unusual going on there, though. Or, well, nothing <i>unexpected</i>. I brought you the Bonerdagon's skull just in case, though. But it's not going to fit under the door, so you'll have to open up and let me in."
questL08Trapper	started	"We've gotten another SOS call for you to check out," the Councillor says. "This one's from John the Trapper. He lives at the base of Mt. McLargeHuge, the tallest of the Big Mountains. Push your map under the door and I'll mark it for you."
questL09Topping	started	"We've gotten another urgent distress call," says the voice. "This one is from Black Angus."
questL10Garbage	started	"Well, no. Apparently there are giant piles of garbage falling out of the sky at the Nearby Plains," replies the Councillor. "We need you to find out what's going on, and put a stop to it."
questL10Garbage	finished	"No need," you reply. "The zombies have eaten most of the garbage already. All that was left was this sweet thing I found."
questL11MacGuffin	started	"As it happens," he replies, "your father was researching an ancient artifact known as the Holy MacGuffin. Now, I don't know anything about it myself, but it seems to me that something called the Holy MacGuffin is probably pretty handy to have when there's a plague of undead on your doorstep, wouldn't you say?"
questL11MacGuffin	finished	"You've recovered the Holy MacGuffin?" the Councillor asks. "Quick, shove it under the door!"
questL12War	started	"I've gotten some reports of trouble brewing on the Mysterious Island of Mystery," the Councillor says. "It sounds like the hippies and frat boys are gearing up for war."
questL12War	step1	"Well, I did it," you tell the panic-room door. "The hippies and frat boys have started an all-out war."
questL12War	finished	"Look in the supply crates and see if we have any medals or anything. Yeah, that'll do." He pushes a medal underneath the door. "There you are, now you're a decorated war hero. Congratulations."
questL13Final	started	"The Naughty Sorceress. Her lair is to the east of the Nearby Plains. You must seek her out and destroy her!"
questL13Final	step13	"I did it!" you excitedly shout to the panic-room door. "I defeated the Naughty Sorceress, and oh man, just wait till I tell you what happened next!"


# Gelatinous Noob
questL02Larva	started	Okay, you're in luck, because I found a quest that's perfect for an adventurer of your... stature. We need you to go out to the marshy part of the Spooky Forest, and bring us back a mosquito larva. I bet you get mosquitoes trying to breed in you all the time, so this should be really easy for you. In case you aren't actually from the Spooky Forest, I'll mark it on your map -- it's in the Distant Woods. Hang on, let me find a real long pencil that I don't care about.	I can kind of see some things wriggling around inside you, but I think they're just bubbles. We need you to bring us a mosquito larva from the Spooky Forest.
questL02Larva	finished	Oh nice, you brought back a mosquito larva! Great, let me just get that... out of you. Fortunately, our janitor was able to lend me a pair of tongs.
questL03Rat	started	So, since you've proven that you can understand instructions and aren't just a gelatinous mass that happened to roll into here at random, I've got another quest for you. We've received word that the owner of the Typical Tavern is having a bit of a rat problem; I'm sure he'd reward you if you took care of it for him. Technically, you shouldn't be allowed inside because of health code regulations, but, well, it's the kind of place where that probably doesn't really matter.	The owner of the Typical Tavern is still bugging us about his rat problems.  Perhaps you could help him? Without getting any of yourself in the beer barrels?
questL04Bat	started	Anyway, we need someone (or something) to kill the Boss Bat.  He can be found in the deepest part of the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains.  Slay him, and return to us with undigested proof of your conquest.	You haven't killed the Boss Bat yet... I can understand if you're worried about getting guano... in you? But this does need to get done. He can be found in the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains.
questL04Bat	finished	Well done!  You have slain the Boss Bat. Feel free to keep whatever part of him that is that I can see floating around in there.
questL05Goblin	started	Okay, this is kind of a big one. Ordinarily we wouldn't entrust this sort of mission to an undifferentiated all-purpose blob, but you've proven yourself fairly capable so far and we pride ourselves on being inclusive. We've just gotten word that the Knob Goblins, who normally keep to themselves over at Cobb's Knob, are planning a major military action against Seaside Town. We need for you to get into the Knob, and neutralize the Goblin King. Like, permanently. Like... digest him, or whatever you do.	You haven't killed the Boss Bat yet... I can understand if you're worried about getting guano... in you? But this does need to get done. He can be found in the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains.<br><br><p>You need to find your way into Cobb's Knob, Blobventurer.  Try looking around the Outskirts for a clue that might help you figure out that map we gave you. Or maybe a nervous system with some sort of centralized brain that can process data? That seems to me like something you would need to have, but hey what do I know?
questL05Goblin	step1	We still need you to neutralize the Goblin King, Blobventurer!
questL05Goblin	finished	Great job killing the Goblin King! Boy, I wish I could have seen his face. ...You know, I think I <i>can</i> see a little of his face in there. Excuse me while I go throw up forever.
questL06Friar	started	The Deep Fat Friars in the Distant Woods are having a problem -- one of their weird religiomagical experiments has gone awry, and some things their letter calls "fey creatures" have invaded their grove. I think that means demons? Say, you wouldn't happen to be...? Nah, you don't look particularly demonic. Anyway, we'd like you to slither out that way and see if you can sort it out.	The Deep Fat Friars still require assistance.  I'm not sure how they'll feel about someone as... moist as you showing up, but you're what we've got right now. You can find them in the Distant Woods.
questL07Cyrptic	started	Recently, an aura of extreme Spookiness has begun to emanate from within the Cyrpt, near the Misspelled Cemetary. We fear that some horrible monster has taken up residence there -- more horrible than you, even! Ha ha, nah, I'm just teasing ya, you seem like a good... mass.	The Spookiness still emanates from the Cyrpt, Blobventurer.  See if you can find and destroy the source, okay?
questL07Cyrptic	finished	Is that some kind of dragon skull I see floating around inside of you? Along with all those other miscellaneous partially-digested bones? Well, you have our thanks for your courageous act of... well, not exactly undefilement, considering. But at least you've replaced the old defilement with a different, lesser defilement that can probably be cleared up with a decent mop.
questL08Trapper	started	Blobventurer!  We've received an urgent letter from the Trapper, requesting your assistance. Well, not yours specifically, but you know. He lives at the base of Mt. McLargeHuge, the tallest of the Big Mountains. Hopefully cold isn't a problem for you? I don't know if you're susceptible to freezing solid or anything. Maybe if you did, you could walk around like a regular person instead of just sludging about?	Hey there, it seems like you're still working on that business with the Trapper, I guess? Probably the cold is slowing you down, like molasses or something. Still, it's gotta be done.
questL09Topping	started	Sorry to trouble you with this, Blobventurer, but we've gotten a... shall we say... cryptic message from Black Angus -- he's one of Loathing's minor nobles.	The Highland Lord, Black Angus, still needs your help, Blobventurer. Well, 'needs' is probably a strong way of putting it, but he's going to bug us until he gets it, so it works out to the same thing.
questL10Garbage	started	Something is amiss, Blobventurer.  The Nearby Plains are filling up with giant piles of garbage, and despite our best efforts, it keeps falling from the sky faster than we can clean it up.  We need you to figure out where it's coming from, and put a stop to it. To be honest, some of the Council wanted to just use you as a garbage disposal and get rid of it that way, but I figure it's better to treat the problem at its source and not just the symptoms, and you've proven yourself pretty competent for a weird-smelling jello person.	Please try to figure out where this garbage is coming from, Blobventurer!  Perhaps you can find a clue by poking around the Nearby Plains? I know that's a lot of ground to cover for what is essentially a giant flan, but we believe in you.
questL10Garbage	finished	We're not sure what you did, Blobventurer, but the garbage finally stopped falling. Thanks a lot!
questL11MacGuffin	started	Ah, Samuel Spade, excellent timing. We've just received a message from the Distant Lands -- it seems that your... uh... this can't be right. Do you even have a father? This message says a renowned archaeologist has gone missing, and says he's your father. Were you originally a regular person? You know what, I'm just gonna resolve not to think about it very hard.	Any luck getting your father's -- I mean, that probably unrelated archaeologist's -- diary and recovering the Holy MacGuffin? It's a pretty important whatchamacallit, so we'd appreciate it if you'd get on that right away.
questL11MacGuffin	finished	Wow! You actually brought back the Holy MacGuffin, Samuel Spade? That's pretty darn impressive -- well done! Now we can pack it in an unlabelled wooden crate and stash it in a secret warehouse full of similar crates somewhere where it's likely that no one will ever see it again. Thanks for your help!
questL12War	started	Blobventurer, we have heard rumors that trouble is brewing on the Mysterious Island of Mystery. The hippies and frat boys are agitating for war. I mean, they've always been a little tense with each other, but now it's getting serious. It's great! We couldn't be happier.	Hey, have you managed to start the war on the Mysterious Island yet? If you can't get them sufficiently worked up, try assassinating Franz Ferdinand. Historically, that tends to work. I guess, failing that, just dress up in one side's uniform and drip goop all around the other side's base?
questL12War	step1	Excellent work, Blobventurer! You've finally managed to get those idiots to fight each other. Now you've got to make sure the battle ends before the tourist season. I mean, would you rather go visit the &quot;beautiful tropical island&quot; or the &quot;body-strewn war zone?&quot;
questL12War	finished	Let me just... drop this medal into you, I guess? There -- you're now a decorated war hero.  Don't let it go to your... pseudopod.
questL13Final	started	Blobventurer!  We've recently received word that the Naughty Sorceress is holding some sort of contest.  We don't know what it means, but we know it doesn't mean anything good, and as such, we have decided that it is time for you to embark upon your final quest.  Seek out and destroy the Naughty Sorceress, who has plagued these lands for so long, and rescue King Ralph XI, whom she has imprismed.	Be strong, Blobventurer, despite your gooey moistness! You must defeat the Naughty Sorceress!  You'll find her Lair just east of the Nearby Plains.
questL13Final	step13	Congratulations, Blobventurer! You have defeated the Naughty Sorceress and brought peace to the land again. ...Usually, I'd make a little joke about how she was your mother, but that seems pretty obviously unlikely unless she was getting up to some stuff that's <i>way</i> naughtier than anyone anticipated.

# License to Adventure
questL02Larva	started	Your mission, Agent, should you choose to accept it (you have no choice), is to procure the latest mosquito larva from the Spooky Forest. Security is tight, and we can't tell you why we need it, but it's of the utmost importance. The coordinates are in this file.	How dare you blow your cover and show up here without completing your mission. Get us that mosquito larva!
questL02Larva	finished	Mission accomplished! You've served your Kingdom well by obtaining the larva.
questL03Rat	started	Word is, we've got a rat in the organization. Several actually. Talk to our contact in the Typical Tavern for the details.	Have you outed the rats? We're all in danger until you visit the Typical Tavern and take care of the problems.
questL04Bat	started	Your next target is a local crime boss, the Boss Bat.  He's gone deep underground in the Nearby Plains and built up an army of bats.  He'll only live once, so kill him and bring back proof of unlife.	The Boss Bat is still alive isn't he? Do your job.
questL04Bat	finished	Well done! You've brought us a view to your killing of the Boss Bat!
questL05Goblin	started	Word on the dark net is that the Knob Goblins, who normally keep to themselves over at Cobb's Knob, are planning a major military action against Seaside Town.	Scout around the the Outskirts for some intel on decrypting that map.
questL05Goblin	step1	What are you doing here? You'll blow your cover and we'll lose our shot at the Goblin King!
questL05Goblin	finished	Well done agent, kill confirmed. Looks like the Goblin King's entire network has fallen apart in his absence.
questL06Friar	started	Something has scared the living daylights out of the Deep Fat Friars. We're deploying you in their grove to see what assistance you can provide.	You need to get control of the situation with the Deep Fat Friars, get back to the Distant Woods.
questL07Cyrptic	started	Seems like there is a new terrorist cell in the Cyrpt, near the Misspelled Cemetary. We suspect there's a ring-leader activating all the local eternal-sleeper cells. Take this gadget from Q-Branch and root him out:	The terrorist have won. Er, are still winning in the Cyrpt. Get back there and sort it out.
questL07Cyrptic	finished	Ah, yes, the Bonerdagon, that notorious underground terrorist. Good job.
questL08Trapper	started	Grab your bag, Agent, you're on the next flight to the Big Mountains. Seems like our operative there, codename the Trapper, needs assistance.	Diamonds are forever, but that ore isn't. Get back and finish the job with Trapper.
questL09Topping	started	Cross the Orc Chasm and do what it takes to make Angus happy.	I know it'd be easier to live and let Black Angus die, but we can't afford that right now, politically.
questL10Garbage	started	Agent, we need you go report to the Nearby Plains and investigate the current bout of anti-eco-terrorism. Giant piles of garbage keep falling from the sky, like some moonraker is up there knocking them down. It's your mission to stop this scourge.	Report back to the Nearby Plains and solve this ecological garbage crisis.
questL10Garbage	finished	Well done, Agent. The garbage has stopped falling. Whatever you did it worked. Here's a token in honor of your service.
questL11MacGuffin	started	we have a complicated mission for you. It seems the father of a distant lands spy has gone missing while searching for a powerful artifact, the Holy MacGuffin. We've stolen his diary and it's stuck in customs in the Distant Lands.	Any luck impersonating the son of the distant lands agent and obtaining the MacGuffin based on the intel in his diary?
questL11MacGuffin	finished	Now we can ship this MacGuffin off for storage at Area 52, so no one can use it.
questL12War	started	Ok, this mission is going to sound a little bit like the various terrorist and criminal plots that you're normally stopping... but we're the good guys, so it's OK.	The Mysterious Island still seems awfully stable. Do we need to send another agent? The world is not enough space for those groups to co-exist. This should be easy!
questL12War	step1	Great, you've started the war.
questL12War	finished	Good job Agent. We told you to make a big public spectacle of ending the war. The frat boys will be much easier to control with their numbers decimated. You deserve a medal!
questL13Final	started	We've recently intercepted chatter suggesting that a shadowy figure is holding some sort of contest. We believe that this may be the leader of the secretive organization behind all the recent criminal activity. Your mission is to enter this contest and destroy this criminal. He's hosting the contest in the Lair of the Naughty Sorceress. If our sources our correct, he had her killed after one too many failures, and took over her lair.	Head to the Naughty Sorceress's lair and take care of the villain now residing there.
questL13Final	step13	We couldn't help but notice that you defeated "Blofeld" and then left the King trapped above the lair. You should probably head back there and free him when you get a chance. You do work for him, after all.

# Pocket Familiars
questL05Goblin	finished	"Thank you for slaying the Goblin King, Adventurer."<p>"Actually it was that kid again. Jeremy Something-or-other. He's a real jerk."<p>"Spiky hair, popped collar? He's always coming here asking for quests so he can get 'EXPs' for his 'pokéfams'. None of us have any idea what that means."<p>"Well," you begin, "'Pokéfams' is short for 'pocket familiars', and--"<p>"Not actually interested," the Councilman says. "Thanks for taking care of that goblin whatever, we'll let you know if we need anything else."
questL07Cyrptic	finished	"Aha!  So the Spookiness was coming from this abominable creature, was it?"<p>"Well, I assume so," you say. "Jerry had already killed it by the time I got there."<p>"Jerry's that kid's name?" the Councilman asks.<p>"Yeah. He's rude as hell."<p>"Is that good or bad? I can't keep up with the lingo you kids use these days."

# Disguises Delimit
questL02Larva	started	We require your aid, Masked Adventurer. We need a mosquito larva. Don't ask why, because we won't tell you. It definitely isn't for wild Masquerade party stunts or for making fake mezcal. In any case, the best place to find a mosquito larva is in the Spooky Forest, which is found in the Distant Woods. We'll mark it on your map for you.	We still need a mosquito larva, Masked Adventurer. Please find us one, in the Spooky Forest.
questL02Larva	finished	Thanks for the larva, Masked Adventurer. We'll put this to hilarious use.
questL03Rat	started	We've received word that the owner of the Typical Tavern, or at least someone who is standing behind the bar at the Typical Tavern, in the Distant Woods, is having a bit of a rat problem. I'm sure he'd reward you if you took care of it for him.	The owner of the Typical Tavern is still bugging us about his rat problems. Perhaps you could help him?
questL04Bat	started	The Council requires another task of you, Masked Adventurer. You must slay the Bo-- uh, the Bonerdagon! Yes, already, ha ha! He can be found in the deepest part of the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains. Slay him, and return to us with proof of your conquest!	You have not yet slain the Bonerdagon. He can be found in the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains.
questL04Bat	finished	You have slain the Bonerdagon! Good job taking on such a difficult boss so early, ha ha!
questL05Goblin	started	We need for you to go deep into the Knob, and nip this problem in the bud, so to speak, by neutralizing the ancient mummy Ed the Undying.	You need to find your way into Cobb's Knob, Adventurer. Try looking around the Outskirts for a clue that might help you figure out that map we gave you.
questL05Goblin	step1	We still need you to neutralize Ed the Undying, Adventurer! You know, the one in Cobb's Knob.
questL05Goblin	finished	Thank you for slaying Ed the Undying, Adventurer! That'll teach him to try and spoil our party!
questL06Friar	started	The Deep Fat Friars in the Distant Woods are having a problem, besides the fact that they're too stodgy and dignified to wear fun masks. One of their experiments has gone awry, and fey creatures have invaded their grove. Please, Masked Adventurer, lend them your assistance!	The Deep Fat Friars still require your assistance. You can find them in the Distant Woods.
questL07Cyrptic	started	Recently, an aura of extreme, um... Hairyness? has begun to emanate from within the Cyrpt, near the Misspelled Cemetary. We fear that some horrible monster has taken up residence there, and begun to rile up the local... devils and robots and stuff?	The Hairyness still emanates from the Cyrpt, Masked Adventurer.  See if you can find and destroy the source, and bring us back proof of your conquest.
questL07Cyrptic	finished	Aha!  So the Hairyness was coming from this <i>abominable</i> creature, was it? Ha ha, see what I did there? Well, you have our thanks, Masked Adventurer, for your courageous act of undefilement.
questL08Trapper	started	Masked Adventurer! We've received an urgent letter from the Trapper, requesting our assistance. I don't know if he's doing the whole Masquerade thing or not, but he signed his letter "The Trapper", so probably not. He's been out in the wilderness for a long time, and kinda forgot how to have fun, if you ask me. Anyway, we're all, like, really busy partying right now, so we were hoping you could go out to his place and see what he wants.	You still have unfinished business with the Trapper, Masked Adventurer.
questL09Topping	started	Sorry to trouble you with this, Adventurer, but we've gotten a cryptic message from, well, someone wearing a mask. But if I'm being honest, it's probably Black Angus -- he's one of Loathing's minor nobles.<p>It's usually safe to ignore him, but he sounded pretty agitated, and given the current political climate we can scarcely afford to ignore him.<p>Could you do us a favor and go to his tower, in the Highlands?  The Highlands are just on the other side of the Orc Chasm.  We'll mark it on your map.	The Masked Guy who is presumably the Highland Lord, Black Angus, still needs your help, Masked Adventurer.
questL10Garbage	started	Something is amiss, Adventurer.  The Nearby Plains are filling up with giant piles of garbage, and despite our best efforts, it keeps falling from the sky faster than we can clean it up. A big celebration like we've got going on here always produces a ton of litter and trash, but usually not quite like this. We need you to figure out where it's coming from, and put a stop to it. Can't have a load of garbage stinking up the place during the festivities!	Please try to figure out where this garbage is coming from, Masked Adventurer! Perhaps you can find a clue by poking around the Nearby Plains.
questL10Garbage	finished	We're not sure what you did, Masked Adventurer, but the garbage finally stopped falling. Thanks a lot! Now we'll only have to deal with, like, glitter and confetti and broken strings of beads and so on.<p>Oh, by the way -- we found this in the garbage when we were cleaning up, and thought you might have some use for it. It'll go great with your costume!
questL11MacGuffin	started	Ah, Masked Adventurer, excellent timing. We've just received a message from the Distant Lands -- it seems that your father, the renowned archaeologist, has gone missing. Apparently, his life's work was to track down an ancient relic known only as the Holy MacGuffin. He left behind his diary, with instructions that it was to be delivered to you -- whoever you are -- but he didn't leave any funds to pay for shipping. So, you'll have to go pick it up yourself.	Any luck getting your father's diary and recovering the Holy MacGuffin? It's a pretty important whatchamacallit, so we'd appreciate it if you'd get on that right away.
questL11MacGuffin	finished	Wow! You actually brought back the Holy MacGuffin, Masked Adventurer? That's pretty darn impressive -- well done! Now we can pack it in an unlabelled wooden crate and stash it in a secret warehouse full of similar crates somewhere where it's likely that no one will ever see it again. Thanks for your help! And speaking of help, help yourself to some confetti! We have crates and crates of the stuff.
questL12War	started	Adventurer, we have heard rumors that trouble is brewing on the Mysterious Island of Mystery. The... guys in masks, are agitating for war. With the other guys in masks. I bet someone accidentally said the wrong thing to the wrong person because they didn't realize who they were talking to. You know how it goes.<p>We'd like you to go over there and make sure that war starts. We don't care how it starts and we don't care who wins, so there's basically no way for you to screw this up, so long as you don't accidentally negotiate a peace accord. Try not to do that.	Hey, have you managed to start the war on the Mysterious Island yet? If you can't get them sufficiently worked up, try assassinating someone wearing a Franz Ferdinand mask. That would be pretty funny!
questL12War	step1	Excellent work, adventurer! You've finally managed to get those idiots to fight each other. Now you've got to make sure the battle ends before the tourist season. I mean, would you rather go visit the &quot;beautiful tropical island&quot; or the &quot;body-strewn war zone?&quot;<p>Well, there's no accounting for taste. We happen to believe most people would prefer the beautiful tropical island. Get out there and rack up some casualties so we can get this over with, will you?<p>If you're not making enough progress, you should try helping some of the other denizens of the island. Unlike every other fantasy Kingdom in the world, if you're stuck you should visit every location and talk to everyone
questL12War	finished	Good job, Masked Adventurer! You finally rid the island of those smelly hippies. The tourist trade is going to boom without them stinking up the place!<p>Now, if only there were something we could do about the frat boys. Oh well, at least they make good margaritas.<p>Here you go -- you're now a decorated war hero.  Don't let it go to your head.	(TBC)
questL13Final	started	Masked Adventurer!  We've recently received word that the Nau-- <font size = 1>(What mask is she wearing? ...What, really? Well okay...)</font> the Boss Bat is holding some sort of contest.  We don't know what it means, but we know it doesn't mean anything good, and as such, we have decided that it is time for you to embark upon your final quest.  Seek out and destroy the Boss Bat, who has plagued these lands for so long, and rescue King... Somebody, whom she has imprismed.<p>Go forth to her Lair, east of the Nearby Plains!  Beat her down!	Be strong, Masked Adventurer! You must defeat the Boss Bat! You'll find her Lair just east of the Nearby Plains.
questL13Final	step13	Congratulations, Masked Adventurer! You have defeated the Boss Bat and brought peace to the land again. Say, did you know she was your mother? And not really a bat?

# Dark Gyffte
questL02Larva	started	We require your aid, Adventurer.  We need a mosquito larva -- we figured that'd be up your alley because, you know, mosquitoes	We still need a mosquito larva, Adventurer.  Please find us one, in the Spooky Forest. Come on, you should feel right at home there.
questL02Larva	finished	Thanks for bringing us a mosquito larva. Hope you aren't feeling like you've betrayed your own kind
questL03Rat	started	We've received word that the owner of the Typical Tavern, in the Distant Woods, is having a bit of a rat problem.  I'm sure he'd reward you if you took care of it for him. Plus, y'know, free lunch!	The owner of the Typical Tavern is still bugging us about his rat problems.  Perhaps you could help him? Just don't drink his blood.
questL04Bat	started	The Council requires another task of you, Adventurer.  You must slay the Boss Bat.  He can be found in the deepest part of the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains.  Slay him, and return to us with proof of your conquest.	You have not yet slain the Boss Bat.  He can be found in the Bat Hole, in the Nearby Plains, but you can probably just sense his presence with your spooky bat powers, right?
questL04Bat	finished	Well done!  You have slain the Boss Bat!
questL05Goblin	started	We've gotten word, Adventurer, that the Knob Goblins, who normally keep to themselves over at Cobb's Knob, are planning a major military action against Seaside Town. We need for you to go deep into the Knob, and nip this problem in the bud, so to speak, by neutralizing the Goblin King.	You need to find your way into Cobb's Knob, Adventurer.  Try looking around the Outskirts for a clue that might help you figure out that map we gave you. Maybe you could sneak around in spooky mist form? Can you do that? Actually maybe don't tell me if you can do that.
questL05Goblin	step1	We still need you to neutralize the Goblin King, Adventurer! I imagine goblin blood probably tastes weird, but you can still stab him or something.
